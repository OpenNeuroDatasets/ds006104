EEG dataset for speech decoding
============================

Dataset Overview
---------------

This dataset contains EEG recordings from a phoneme discrimination task with TMS.
The data were collected during two related studies in 2019 and 2021.

Study 1 (2019, Session 01):
- 8 participants (P01-P08)
- Focus on CV and VC phoneme pairs
- 2 blocks: CV pairs and VC pairs
- TMS targeted to LipM1 (-56, -8, 46) and TongueM1 (-60, -10, 25)

Study 2 (2021, Session 02):
- 16 participants (S01-S16)
- Expanded to include single phonemes and phoneme triplets
- 4 blocks: single phonemes, CV pairs, real words, and pseudowords
- Additional TMS targets included Broca's area (BA 44: -51, 7, 23) and verbal memory region (BA 6: -46, 1, 41)

Task Description
---------------

Participants listened to speech sounds and identified stimuli with a button-press response.
The stimuli included:
1. Single phonemes - Consonants (/b/, /p/, /d/, /t/, /s/, /z/) and vowels (/i/, /E/, /A/, /u/, /oU/)
2. Phoneme pairs - CV and VC combinations of the phonemes
3. Phoneme triplets - Real and pseudowords constructed of CVC sequences

TMS Methodology
--------------

Detailed information about TMS parameters can be found in the sourcedata/tms_metadata/tms_parameters.json file.
TMS was applied using a Magstim Super Rapid Plus1 stimulator with a figure-of-eight 40 mm coil.
Stimulation was delivered at 110% of resting motor threshold as paired pulses with 50ms interpulse interval.

Detailed information about the methodology and results can be found in the associated publication:
Moreira et al. "An open-access EEG dataset for speech decoding: Exploring the role of articulation and coarticulation"



Directory Structure
------------------

The dataset follows BIDS convention with the following structure:
/sub-[subject]/ses-[session]/eeg/
Where subject is P01-P08 for Study 1 and S01-S16 for Study 2.
Session is 01 for Study 1 and 02 for Study 2.
